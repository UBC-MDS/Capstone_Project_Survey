## Pull Request Process guidelines

1. Before work begins, ensure an issue is created. This assists team members in understanding what work is ongoing and who is working on the issue. It is good practice to reference the issue number in your branch name, so if a pull request is produced, the relevant issue is highlighted.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. In addition to referencing the specific issue the pull request addresses, please explain in the comments the changes that were made and what was fixed and/or functionality was added. In case of a bug fix, please specify the bug that was fixed and provide test case examples.
4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers
