#### Reflection on UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys  

Our survey will not collect directly identifying information such as name, student number and SIN number. What we will collect are MDS students' choices of capstone projects, their ages, their education backgrounds, etc. Even though a single variable on its own could not identify an individual, variables combined may expose individuals to identification. In consideration of this risk, we will treat all information collected as "personal information" and manage it according to the guidelines outlined below.  

As such, according to the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), we should store the information we collect only in Canada and only access in Canada. To comply with it, we decided to use a Canada based online survey tool to conduct our survey.  

According to FIPPA, an IP address constitutes indirectly identifying information. Since we have no interest in survey respondents' IP addresses, we will switch off the IP tracking feature provided by the survey tool.  

If it important to enable a participant to make an informed decision about participating in our online survey. To achieve this goal, we need to include a cover letter in our survey. In this cover letter, we will include: the study title, contact information of the PI, a short description of the study, risks and benefits, limits to confidentiality, a statement that participation is optional, and the UBC Research Participant Complaint Line text.
