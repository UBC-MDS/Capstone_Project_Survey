#### Research Question
Does an MDS student's perceived skill level with statistics or machine learning influence their decision to rank a (mainly) statistics or machine learning project as their top choice for capstone?

For the result and analysis, please refer to our [final report](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/Capstone_Project_Survey/blob/master/doc/final_report.md)
